Raiser WP is a framework to assist with developing custom WordPress themes.

## About

Raiser WP aims to make developing custom WordPress themes an enjoyable experience. Raiser WP gives the developer a simple set of tools and structure. Written with OOP patterns and encapsulated logic, without losing flexibility or extensibility.

Raiser WP was born out of the frustration of creating custom WordPress themes. Seemingly simple requirements were hard to create. Large functions.php files. Spaghetti code, hooking into hooks inside hooks.

Gaining inspiration from the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework and the WordPress plugin [ACF](http://advancedcustomfields.com/), Raiser WP was created to abstract away some of the WordPress stuff, and offer clean ways of building custom themes without worrying about the overhead of 'the WordPress way'.

## Features

Raiser WP's core features include:

* Clean theme folder structure, helping you keep your code organized.
* Array based config files - no more Googling for WordPress snippets to turn on/off WP features.
* Block based custom field functionality - manage custom fields within the source code and not the database.
* Support for the highly recommended [ACF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin.
* Laravel inspired content modeling, to define custom post types and taxonomies.
* Eager loading functionality, making custom block data available within the $post object inside theme template files.
* CLI for easy creation of elements.
* Gutenberg block support.
* Ajax load more and pagination options.
