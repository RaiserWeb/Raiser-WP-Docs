Raiser WP provides access to a command line interface library to help you perform setup tasks to stub out files required for specific features. You do not have to use the CLI, but it speeds up development and ensures you have the correct file structures in place.

To use the CLI, first open your terminal and cd into the raiser-wp folder within your project.

```
$ cd "/path/to/your/site/wp-content/plugins/raiser-wp"
```
OR
```
$ cd "/path/to/your/site/wp-content/mu-plugins/raiser-wp"
```
