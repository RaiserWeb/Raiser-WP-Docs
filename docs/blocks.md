Raiser WP uses the concept of blocks to encapsulate custom fields. Blocks can be defined in the PHP, and assigned to posts/pages via assignment in your block class.

Blocks can be registered inside the /raiser-wp/blocks folder within your theme.

```
$ php raiser make:block "Block Name"
```

## Block Class Structure

Example structure of a Block called "Client"

```
class Client_Block extends Raiser_ACF_Block {

	public $block_name = 'client';

	public function init(){

		$this->block_settings = [
			'title'         => 'Client',
		];
		
		$this->fields = [
			[
				'label' => 'Client Name',
				'name' => 'client_name',
				'type' => 'text',
				'required' => 1,
			],
			[
				'label' => 'Client Description',
				'name' => 'client_description',
				'type' => 'text',
			],
			// add additional fields as required
		];	


	}	

}
```

## Block Fields

Raiser WP uses ACF fields. Fields for the block are defined in the $this->field array inside the init() function. All field types of ACF can be found on their [website](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/)

> Note, you do not need to define a key to the field. This will be auto-generated by Raiser-WP in the form "[block_name]_[field_name]". If you need to, you can define your own keys

## Field Choices

For fields with a choices array (eg a select field) you can define the choices inside a function within the class
```
public function get_FIELDNAME_choices(){
	return [
		1 => 'Option One',
		2 => 'Option Two'
	];
}
```
